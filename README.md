# DATABASE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION


A desktop app I wrote in Python using Tkinter, meant as a personal project and homework for a college course - Programming Interfaces for Databases.

MySQL connector library used in order to connect to the MySQL Workbench and get access to the databse itself, used Tkinter for the GUI and simplicity regarding user friendliness and navigation. Nothing fancy but a good exercise and great project.
